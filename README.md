# Github Create Repo

## What it does?

* Github Create Repo is a small website made using NestJS in the backend and basic HTML CSS in the frontend.  
* It allows anyone to authorize their github account and the code will create a sample repo with some files in their account.
* On clicking on `Create Repo` button, it will take the user to their Github account where they can grant permissions to their account.
* After authorisation is complete, it will create a repo named `sample-code` in the userâ€™s account with some sample code.
